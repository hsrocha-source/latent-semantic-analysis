I've been writing this for a couple weeks now and decide that I need to get this done today so hopefully it reads well. This post is my personal opinion and analysis. Welcome any questions and constructive feedback. For full disclosure I invest in PLTR and nothing beats doing your own research in addition to reading other people's DDs.\", '**Deep value investment for the most important software company, PT $45 EOFY:**', 'I believe Palantir has been and will continue to disrupt not just the software industry but how dozens of sectors and industries operate. What we’re seeing here might be the next Amazon with a company that does not mind short-term losses and invests aggressively to achieve long-term hyper and exponential growth. If you look at companies that shy away from making such a level of investments into technology to please their shareholders in the short-term, such short-sighted actions do no justice for those wanting to hold onto their investments over the medium- to long-term. I am incredibly excited about the recent Titan release with 4 new modules that includes an AI assistant and an automatic reporting tool. My target price for PLTR is $45 EOFY, key modelling assumptions include:', \"* Palantir will be a +$20bn revenue business by 2030, driven by significant growth in number of customers and revenue per customer, partially offset by 1-2% churn each year. Growth rate +30% over the long-term is consistent with what we've seen with Amazon / AWS and Salesforce. There will be increasing demand for data analytics solutions and full stack operating systems like Palantir as corporate/governments undergo transformations and identify new use cases for the data that they have.\\n* Gross margin around 74%, in line with most other software companies.\\n* Exponential growth and margin support by Apollo's automation of the implementation and post-implementation support would enable massive implementation across thousands of large-to-medium-size customers that would otherwise not be possible with the current headcount at Palantir. Like Alex Karp said, software allows small companies to compete against rivals 10x their size.\\n* EBIT margin will expand to 27% (including stock-based compensation) by 2030. This is conservative when we compare to MSFT which is operating at +35%. I also assume a normalised 18% on sales & marketing which is on the low side if you compare to CRM at 40-45%, but given Palantir's current partnership model I think this is justifiable. 17% R&D and 5% General & admin.\\n* Significant shareholder dilution going forward. I use a share base of 2.2-2.3B for my per share calculation to factor in the dilution. Assume no share buyback.\\n* Normalisation of interest rates to 3% and lower beta (basically lower volatility) over the next 10 years.\", \"Note that while my PT is definitely lower than other moonshots on this sub (I'm talking 60/100/150/500), this is based on readily available datapoints, moderately conservative assumptions and assuming investors will not be willing to pay crazy multiples for the stock.\", \"**Management is sandbagging revenue guidance, are we doing the same?** Management has been overly-conservative and this was one of the main factors causing the share price to tank following what I would consider a very positive Q4 and FY20. With 45% revenue growth for Q1 and 30% for FY21, this implies that Palantir has to really mess up a lot of things in one or two of the remaining quarters (y/y growth below 20-30%) to miss or even to just achieve their guidance. Below is an analysis I've done to show if their guidance is true they will grow at \\\\~19% y/y in one of the quarters which isn't great. So it is more likely than not these guys will outperform their revenue guidance by a significant margin this year. With their 2025 revenue guidance of $4bn, I believe this is also very conservative and it is not difficult to believe the annual growth rate can be 35-40% y/y instead of the guided 30% CAGR. By 2030, at the current rate of growth plus a bit of uplift this business can get to $20bn in revenue or even $30bn – such growth is not unheard of if you’ve been following Amazon / AWS and see what they’ve achieved. Also, the TAM for PLTR might be a lot larger than what management has guided (I note from [C3.AI](http://c3.ai/) filing that they estimate their market opportunities to be in the range of $240bn and growing) but of course penetration of that TAM will prove challenging for Palantir.\", '&#x200B;', '[FY21 revenue scenario, Assume Q2 and Q3 both grow at 30&#37; y\\\\/y, this means Q4 grows at 19&#37; y\\\\/y](https://preview.redd.it/4nu7jwnynao61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8bd9288faf885fca364e9e837ee28946216231)', 'On another note, in FY21-22, we might see a significant number of customers entering the Expand and Scale phases. In 2020, Palantir had been able to acquire 400+ new Acquire customers on top of the existing \\\\~125, making their customer pool 500+ at the lower end. If they manage to convert all of these new Acquire to Expand/Scale that would add +$4bn to their top line, assuming each customer roughly pays $10m a year to Palantir for the software.', \"**This business can become extremely profitable.** While both Alex and Cathie have focused their attention on investing more into the business by forgoing profitability now, in the long-term all businesses need to be profitable so I don't suggest we ignore profitability completely. The case might be that Palantir can become a lot more profitable than what we currently see with the level of automation Apollo and future add-ons can handle. Operating leverage will also enable PLTR to expand their margins. In a bull case, gross margin and operating margin may expand to +75% and 30-35% respectively as stock-based compensation further normalises in the future. R&D, sales & marketing and other expenses will still grow in absolute terms but will eventually become smaller portions of revenue.\", '**Future stock-based compensation will improve.** From PLTR’s SEC filing, I was able to get a sense of what the stock-based compensation will be over the next 3-4 years. I forecast stock-based compensation will reduce from $1.1bn in FY20 to \\\\~$414m per year over FY21-23. I also looked at the stock-based compensation expense of other software companies to make sure that there is nothing odd going on with Palantir (see figure below). For my modelling I assume that over the long-term, stock-based compensation will stabilise around 8% of revenue (which is a lot lower than companies like ServiceNow but still above average for well established software companies). Besides the financial, it is noted that stock-based compensation allows Palantir to attract the best people as well as providing their people with incentives to further their contributions to the business.', '&#x200B;', '[Arithmetic mean for FY10-21 stock-based compensation &#37; of revenue for selected software companies.

The trajectory of the stock will likely be sideway for long and moon/mars long into the future. The point when they reach profitability will be key to the moon phenomenon, which I'd say they can be profitable earliest 2023, base case 2025. So just to reiterate the same thing that Alex Karp has said but cater to our short-termism a bit better, if you're a short-term investor with possibly less than 2 years investment horizon in this stock (2 years is at the very least) then I'd go for SPACs or follow meetkevin investments....\", '**Key challenges to Palantir:**', 'We know Palantir has a very good product, but there is much to prove with its business model. Below I note some key challenges:', \"* **Relationship with IBM and Amazon:** It is great that Palantir has been able to secure two very good partnerships with two juggernauts. However, the level of leverage that Palantir can pull in these partnerships is weak imo as Palantir is still very small and has limited capacity to push through sales. Over time, I'd expect Palantir to become increasingly independent from IBM and Amazon, with the two only providing the hardware and cloud infrastructure for Palantir and Palantir to substantially upscale its direct salesforce to capture more share of the market.\\n* **Competition:** Though we may say the TAM is $120bn, $500bn, $1T or even $2T, it is clear Palantir won't capture the entire TAM. Organisations may continue to use their existing systems or choose another vendor. Palantir's potential customers may not have the same horizon as Alex Karp's and they may opt for quick one-off solutions rather than a long-term commitment to Gotham/Foundry/etc. Such level of inertia will slow down adoption of Palantir's products. There might be other companies jumping into this space. I do note however that it will also be challenging for other companies to compete against Palantir, especially the bigger players as their large structure prevents them from investing sufficiently for what is still viewed as a niche market.\\n* **Shareholder dilution:** Part of the reason why it seems PLTR share price does not go up as much on green days is the market pricing in the dilution. While we may think the share base to calculate the per share valuation is 1.83B, there's 500-700m more shares that will eventually dilute the stock, lowering the per share valuation (assuming no share buyback). This factor is also the main driver of the discrepancy in the PT that people have for PLTR, not really revenue and operating income by themselves alone. I note that this dilution is common for many companies but it is however very significant for Palantir. Valuation needs to consider dilution.\\n* **Transparency into financial disclosures:** Palantir currently does not have the best disclosures in their 10K/10Q/S1 if one has spent time looking at other software companies' SEC filings. For one, there is no breakdown between software and services in their revenue which makes it hard to understand how much of their revenue is coming from the actual software. The stock-based compensation structure is difficult for investors to grasp that somewhat have hidden the significant level of dilution that we're going to see in the future (that compounds with the investor base dominated by retail). The Acquire/Expand/Scale disclosure does not exactly show how many customers have moved from Acquire into Expand and so on. Overall, Palantir can do a lot better in their financial reporting.\\n* **Public relations:** In my opinion Palantir has not exactly done its best in terms of communications to its investors and obviously maintaining good relationships with the media and Wall Street. While Alex Karp may like the fact that retail investors are dominating the base, I think a more balanced investor base with growing interest from institutional investors will be healthy for the stock (which is actually what we're seeing more of). Good relationships with Wall Street will be key in balancing the investor base. This is not saying PLTR to forgo all of its long-term values but rather they should engage with Wall Street in more regular and healthy debates that will benefit both Palantir and the St, and giving the St more opportunities to understand the company better. This is also not saying Wall St should all put BUY ratings on PLTR because they have the right to have their own view, but a good relationship will give any PT and rating a more objective touch. In terms of communications, I envision Palantir to somewhat move in the direction of Salesforce which has done very well in this regards by developing free online courses and low-code/no-code chill-out conversations that investors/layman can jump in. This would further Palantir along the adoption curve and make Palantir a household name. Recently, the Titan release is not known unless someone goes through multiple loops to find the link so such release should have been announced publicly either via the News section or on Twitter.\", '**Palantir is still trading cheap compared to some of the recently listed software companies**', \"Price/Sales or P/S is the key metric for a company like Palantir. Anyway, you can see that Palantir is trading cheaper than 6 other companies at 41x (Snowflake, Crowdstrike, Roblox, Zscaler, C3 AI and Datadog), 4 of which have an average BUY rating from analysts. One thing to bear in mind though is that the whole tech sector has been trading rich for a while now so it is uncertain at this stage to know whether there will be a correction/normalization of multiples in a rising interest rates / inflationary environment. In other words, will 20x P/S be the new normal? Or +40x P/S will be here to stay, let's hope for the latter.\", '&#x200B;', '[Software comparables Price\\\\/Sales ratio.

According to sources such as S3 Partners, Ortex, Fintel, Yahoo! Finance, and a few others, most short interest estimates I have found range from 20%-80% of the float, not accounting for shorts through ETFs. This is down from estimates of about 140%-150% during the first squeeze, if this information is to be correct, it is clear that the first squeeze had numerous shorts covering, but not all shorts were covered. This leaves us with the current range of 20%-80% interest, which is still quite high.  \\n&#x200b;  \\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BSpHXlu.jpg  \\n&#x200b;  \\nNow, based on Fintel information, we can see that institutional put/call ratio is 2.81, meaning there is still a large portion of shorts compared to long positions. We can also see that for the past 10 trading days ~23% of trading volume has been short sales, which could provide support for the theory of the price being shorted so it doesn't go up too much.    \\n&#x200b;  \\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Mp5cJXD.jpg    \\n&#x200b;  \\n#TSLA Graph  \\nNow, if we look at Tesla's graph from 2020 to now, we can see the process of a slow short squeeze along with catalysts and improving value for the company. (Namely Model 3 sales)     \\n&#x200b;  \\nTowards the beginning of 2020 Tesla short interest was estimated to be ~20%, ending now at ~5%.  \\n&#x200b;  \\nTesla seemed to follow a similar pattern to what we are seeing starting now, where it has a bit of a squeeze, corrects, more squeeze, corrects, rinse and repeat.     \\n&#x200b;  \\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KB4hKRu.jpg    \\n&#x200b;  \\n#Is This Similar?\\nBased on the numbers available and the patterns available, it appears this could be a similar squeeze to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze. However, this scenario is also different, we are dealing with a situation with a lot more press and larger short volume, not to mention an almost war like scenario, David and Goliath style.   \\n&#x200b;  \\nIt is also worth noting, company catalysts fueled the Tesla squeeze, similarly we can see the recent squeeze from $40 to $200 was because of digital transformation plans, but for this to follow the same pattern catalysts would need to continue coming.  \\n&#x200b;  \\n#Unknowns\\nNow, a few things I wanted to briefly go over while I have my little stage here. First, there's no way to tell how earnings will affect the stock, if it will. Earnings could come out surprisingly well or have good guidance, and it could be a catalyst. Shorts could use the opportunity to push the price down more, after all markets tend to react negatively to earnings, it would be a good way to hide it. It may entice some of you to sell prior to earnings and buy again at a lower price, however because of the strange nature of this stock, if you want to be here for a potential squeeze it would be better to just HODL.   \\n&#x200b;  \\nI would also like to note, there's no way for us to accurately see who is currently still short GME, such as if Citadel or Melvin still hold the same positions they were in before. Melvin reported they owned 60,000 puts on GME with no calls to hedge as of 12/31/2020, you can see this in their [most recent 13F filing, which was filed 2/26/21.](https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-21-000248/)  \\n&#x200b;  \\nIf you would like to see the most recent info on institutional ownership, take a visit to [holdings channel, which gives a good view based on the most recent information from filings.](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=gme)    \\n&#x200b;     \\nFrom this we can see that Citadel and Melvin are (unsurprisingly) some of the largest short positions, however Melvin has no hedging but Citadel also owns a large amount of calls, which I would assume is to hedge.      \\n&#x200b;  \\nThat's all I have for you apes today, thanks for reading, and I feel as though this is required;      \\nNot financial advice.\"], [\"I have noticed that a lot of here can't read so of course I decided to write up about Bonds. Who cares nobody is going to read it anyways.\", 'A bond is a loan. When you buy a bond from an entity, you are essentially loaning them your money.  like any loans, a bond has a face value ( principal) and coupon rate( interest you get for loaning the money until the loan matures). So when I buy a $1000 bond, let say for the face value which is $1000 and a coupon rate of 2%( a year), it means  I will get 2% of the principal which is $20 yearly and at the end of the term when it matures I get my principal back.', 'A bond yield ( there are different ways of calculating this but for the most part you need to know yield to maturity rate)  =  annual coupon payment / bond price. so for the example above the yield is the same as coupon rate of 2%.', 'So reading this you might ask yourself that why the yield fluctuates. Referring back to the yield formula above, for yields to go up, either the coupon amount has to increase or the bond price needs to drop. coupon is usually fixed so the only way the yields can go up is for the bond to depreciate in price. Remember regardless of how much you pay for a $1000 bond, you will get the same coupon payment and $1000 principal at the end.', \"Imagine you are selling a car  and you have a buyer who is willing to pay $9500 and your friend asks you if you would sell the car to her and she will pay you $10000 in a year. Is this a fair deal? In order to answer this question you need to determine how much $10000 a year from now is worth today aka present value(PV) of future cash (FV). This is a fundamental concept in putting a value on an assets(long duration) like stocks or bonds. In simple terms, what you do is to look at the rates for a one year loan and let's say it is 5%.\", 'PV of $10000 = $10000 / (1+0.05) = $9523', 'so if you wait a year you get more money for your car.', '&#x200B;', \"In the example above, I assumed there was no inflation ( =0). but what if the inflation is 2%?

The higher the inflation, the lower the PV of a future cash flow.', '&#x200B;', 'This is the main reason for the all the volatility in the past few weeks. As the inflation fears grow, people start discounting the value of 10 year treasury notes to PV and realizing that it is not worth it to pay as much as last year to buy the bonds because of the fear of erosion in the pv due to an inflation hike and are paying less to buy bonds and that causes the bond yields to go up.', '&#x200B;', 'A similar method is used for stock valuation to determine the PV of future cash flows of a company. in this process, an investor determines the PV of  the future earnings (cash flow) of a company and based on that calculates a fair price. So for the growth stocks where most of the cash flow is in the future, the the higher the inflation the lower the PV of those cash flows and hence you see multiples on those stocks drop.', 'So in high inflation environments, value stocks are preferred since a good chunk of their earnings is happening at the present especially the ones with pricing power. i.e. banks, energy, commodities and industrial.'], ['Options lessons part deux', '*As an addendum to my previous post on delta hedging*', 'Delta hedging, pin risk, gamma, max pain: ', '**Dynamic delta hedging** -', 'Ex: AMC a dealer sold a $14 3/19 call on 3/9 when the stock was at $10. The delta was 30% so they bought 30% of their AMC exposure and were delta neutral. As the stock moves up and down the delta changes (the rate of change is gamma).

When the stock is at $10 the chance of a $14 call being ITM in a week is... 30% let’s say (much lower for a normal stock but AMC vol is obviously sky high). The chance of an $14 put being ITM is let’s say... 70%. As the stock moves higher both call and put sellers are buying stock.\\nWith the stock at $13.50 the call delta goes to 48% and the put delta goes to 52% as an example. ', 'This week a bunch of call option buyers came in bidding up higher strikes. This forced dealers to buy more stock to hedge. This causes the price to rise. Now as the price of the stock rises, so does the delta (the rate of this change is the gamma). So now the dealers have to buy MORE stock. The closer to expiry the more gamma there is in at the money (ATM) options. So dealers are buying more and more stock which is making the price go up (obviously) which means the call delta goes up which makes them buy more stock. Tada! A **gamma squeeze**. ', 'The WHOLE time they are hedging. Obviously some of them probably couldn’t hedge fast enough and lost money but generally speaking, they are long the same amount of equity exposure as they are short through options.', '“Gamma squeezes” work both ways.

They’re not waiting until Friday at 4:00 to find out if they’re on the hook for millions of dollars.', 'Let’s keep using AMC as an example. Here comes Friday/ expiry and the stock is right around $14.  Lots and lots of contracts are being closed out for profits/ losses and dealers are unwinding hedges.', 'Dealers short calls all the way up to $13.50 are almost 100% hedged (they’ve bought almost 100% of their stock). The probability the calls they are short will be ITM is almost 100%. Dealers short calls from let’s say.... $14.50 and up are almost 0% hedged (in a normal situation this would be actually 0. For AMC it was non zero) ', 'Reminder: A LOT of this is being unwound on Friday. Lots of positions are getting closed out and dealers are buying/ selling/ shorting stock to stay neutral.

(Gamma is huge here. It’s the rate of change of the delta. It’s changing a lot!)', '**Right around $14 it’s a huge question mark** whether remaining open call and put options will be exercised or not (reflected in the delta being right around 50% - it’s a 50/50 chance). The dealer doesn’t know if it should be 100% hedged or 0% hedged! Probabilistically they should be 50% hedged. But if the stock gaps down at 3:59:58 the call seller is over hedged and if it spikes at 3:59:58 they are under hedged. If the stock closes at $13.95, calls won’t be exercised, they don’t need to have shares. If the stock closes at $14.05 calls will be exercised, they need to have shares. So heading into the close they are selling every time the stock goes below $14 and buying every time it goes above $14. Yes, they are buying high and selling low. They sold options thus are short vol/ short gamma.', 'On the other hand if dealers are LONG calls or puts they are doing the opposite. A dealer long a $14 put wants to be long 100% of their exposure at $13.98 and 0% at $14.02. So they are long vol, and buying low and selling high.', 'So. The reason you’ll see a spike in volume if there is large OI in ATM options is due to a) people closing out their contracts at gains/ losses (remember very few options are actually exercised) \\nb) lots and lots of dealer hedging in both directions.

If they’re net long vol you’ll see the stock stay pinned near the strike price. (but delta hedging isn’t the only thing happening in the market! This is all happening in the middle of regular buying and selling!)

If the stock closes at $14.05 someone will likely not want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (.05 below market). Sellers of options that are ATM on expiry face some uncertainty that is almost impossible to hedge. If the stock is bouncing around $13.95 or $$14.05 or $13.99 it becomes extremely difficult to predict if the option will be exercised. Most brokers “auto-exercise” any option that is ITM by .01.

The dollars here are small though... it’s not, “if it closes above $200 I’m screwed and have to buy millions of dollars of stock,” it’s “if it closes above $200 there’s still some uncertainty on whether I’ll be assigned on some calls that are still open so I’m taking some weekend risk.” **MOST of the options have already been closed out before 4 PM.

Now, I do not know too much about technical analysis… I analyze things from a fundamental perspective, and those of you who are dooming and glooming like your pants have caught fire need to stop and take a breath.', 'I am not going to lie, and state I was not laughing when I was seeing some stuff like “It might go down below 7.5,” or “Could it head to six or five?” Well, the tangible price to book value of UWMC is 7.65. The price-to-tangible book value ratio measures a company’s market price in relation to its tangible book value. The ratio denotes how much investors are paying for each dollar of physical assets. In short, if you liquidated everything, you would get 7.65 dollars per share. As it stands that is a tangible price to tangible book value ratio of 1.169. The CEO has already confirmed that the first quarter of 2021 is going to be gangbusters, and surpass the last quarter of Q4 2020 which was… You guessed it, gangbusters. So why is everyone screaming at the top of their lungs, and acting like this bad boy is going to nosedive worse than CDProjectRed’s reputation after Cyberpunk came out? This despite the tangible book to value ratio easily, easily, going above $8 dollars a share after Q1 2021. I will try to answer that in a bit but let me go ahead and go through some other valuation metrics.', 'A value stock refers to shares of a company that appears to trade at a lower price relative to its fundamentals, such as dividends, earnings, or sales, making it appealing to value investors. Common characteristics of value stocks include high dividend yield, low P/B ratio, and a low P/E ratio. As a generalized rule of thumb P/E ratios for value stocks are meant to sit anywhere between 11 to 15.', 'The 4th Quarter of 2020 was very good for UWMC as they got a net income of $1.37B and for the full year it was a net income of $3.38B. There was also a total gain margin of 305 bps in 4Q20 (3.05%) compared to 110BPS in 4Q19. It is important to note that for Q4 2020, this is pre-tax and so the net income is $1.0925 Billion. Starting from Q1 2020, it will be post tax for net income. Total assets at the close of Q4 2020 was $11,493,283 (Spread across cash and cash equivalents, mortgage loans at fair value, and mortgage servicing rights).', 'UWMC maintained an average application to clear to close time of approximately **18** days in Q4 2020. This is while the industry average (in management’s estimate of the industry) grew to -52- days (This is due to the mortgage and refinance boom). This was 10 days higher than the nine-month average off 42 days. For the month of December, the days to close was 16 days, while management’s estimate grew to 54 days. Furthermore, the delinquency and forbearance rates are well below industry averages.', 'Employees grew from 4,907 on December 31, 2019 to 7,475 on December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of 52 percent in employees and is a bullish indicator of the mortgage market in 2021 and beyond. A part of this is likely because they intend to restart their jumbo offerings which are expected to go live in March 2021 and which management expects to materially increase purchase volume during the remainder of 2021. The wholesale channel, which is where UWM is #1 and which is their sole focus, continues to be viewed as the growth channel of the residential mortgage industry. It represented only 17.2% of the total mortgage market for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Of that 17.2%, UWM had grown its market share to 34.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Finally, the non-funding debt to equity is .49 which is important for later.', 'Management is projecting Q1 2021 closed loan volume between $52 Billion and $57 Billion, which would represent an increase of 22.6% and 34.4% from Q1 2020. The total gain margin of 2-2.35% is an increase of 110.5%-142.1% compared to .95% in the first quarter of 2020.', 'Yes, yes, but what does that mean? Well, we know that they beat Q4 2020 EPS by a staggering 30 cents and reported a .62 Earnings Per Share. We also know that it will be even better, for Q1 2020, but that analysts are expecting .40 for this quarter, and a FY of 1.27 EPS (which is ludicrously low). So, let us look at the future P/E ratio in a normal scenario, and in an analyst scenario (analyst scenario being the worst-case scenario). For the normal scenario we use Q4 2020 EPS so .62\\\\*4= 2.48 in earnings per share for the FY EPS (I am projecting higher Q1 and Q2 revenues, to account for the slowdown in winter). This would make for a future P/E ratio in 2021 of 3.608 if the price stuck to 8.95. A P/E ratio of 11 would mean that the stock would hold a price of 27.28. Let us look at the analyst average now. A current P/E ratio of 7.04 to the current price point of 8.95 would apply **right now** if the consensus analyst average were met. For a P/E ratio of 11 the price point of UWM would have to be 15.62. Alright. Undervalued. Gotcha. But let us see if it meets the other metrics. Even after Rocket’s massive sell off, the price to earnings ratio for Rocket is 13.56, and they hold a market cap of 49.55B. Please remember that the tangible book value of UWMC is over $11 Billion, and as such that is over 20 percent of the market cap of RKT which is a diversified company but also is in the Wholesale Mortgage Market and holds the title of 2nd largest wholesale mortgager while also having a private broker channel with higher margin.', 'At .40 in dividends per year, the yield at $8 is 5%, and at $9 it is 4%. This is deep value, as the stock made a profit margin of $3.38 Billion. As the market cap of the company is currently sitting at 13.4 Billion… This represents a profit margin to market cap of 23.5% rounded up. The tangible book to value ratio also means that the company could conceivably pay the current dividend with no profits for over a decade. As such, the dividend yield is safe and is in fact due for a raise. Q1 2021 is expected to be quite profitable as well, and I expect management to beat their projections, but we will discuss why later. It is also important to note that the balance sheet is a fortress to weather downturns.', 'But, HB, that is not what we are scared about. We are scared about 2023, and 2024! Well, before I begin, let me make one thing clear. The mortgage market is here to stay, and it will be continuously growing. The only question is at what rate. I seriously hope you are not betting against the mortgage market, because the only thing that will kill it is WWIII, or depopulation. However, I will entertain your doom and gloom fanfiction because I am nice like that. There are currently around 75 mortgage companies operating in the United States in a highly fragmented market. UWMC engages mostly in the provisioning of home purchases, while Rocket is more geared toward refinancing. Let us get one thing out of the way first, before I continue. The notion that refinancing was all pushed forward and that the mortgage industry just had its income all front loaded is absurd. Before Covid the Federal Reserve was hiking rates up, and it is only because of Covid and the Fed’s resultant dovish policy that the interest rates crashed below 3 percent for the first time ever. Rates would have otherwise gone up. This has helped mortgage companies because they conducted refinances that would have otherwise never occurred. Furthermore, at least in earlier quarters, the interest rate was effectively above 3% because of the sheer demand which allowed companies to charge above a 3% rate. Furthermore, WFH has allowed home prices to increase across the spectrum from rural homes to exurban and suburban homes due to increased demand. In the case of a mass market crash, UWM’s dominant position in the wholesale mortgage industry will allow it to gobble up market share from struggling other mortgagers, while it is fortress of a balance sheet will allow it to reduce profit margin to be more competitive and effectively aid itself in squeezing out competitors. Finally, it can just flat out weather the storm due to its balance sheet, while keeping its dividend. This will happen regardless, but a crash would accelerate this.', 'Now, for the more likely scenario. Demand is booming, but inventory is scarce, and it takes time for supply to be made to meet demand. Let us look at the current demand, however. To look at this, we need to look at the stock of home builders. Therefore, let us look at Lennar. Lennar’s quarterly earnings per share were up 60.63% over the past year to 2.04 which beat the estimate of $1.71. It has a P/E ratio of 9.67 however, and a fair market value that would have it a little above that. More generally, the estimate is that it will take 5 years for home builders to get inventory equivalent to demand as homebuilding takes time. What does that mean exactly? A metric fuck ton of buyers, but only so many homes. In that sense, perhaps interest rates are not the boogie man that people think they are. Why? Well, I’ll put supply and demand in banana speak… Just for you. You are all apes, and you live in trees, but you need to buy the tree you sleep in with banana’s. The trees cost too much for you, so you need to take out a mortgage to buy the tree with your bananas. However, the bananas per month expected of you is rising because of higher interest rates that those pesky humans are demanding. So, less apes want to buy trees, and as a result, the price to buy a tree drops to meet demand until demand equals supply… Except supply is so low that demand will always beat supply even with higher interest rates!', 'To account for all this lack of homes, people are deciding to do cash out refinances in 2021 as a means of getting cash out of their home so that they can upgrade their starter homes to fit their growing families. Furthermore, sales of new homes were up 19% on an annual basis according to a MarketWatch Economic Report on February 24, 2021 even though the cost of new homes were rising due to increased lumber costs. That was a stunning 4.3% above the already upwardly revised pace of 885,000 in December. Furthermore, inventory dropped slightly to a four-month supply. A six-month supply of homes is generally considered indicative of a balanced market. What does that mean? Simple, demand outstrips supply for newly built homes. Hard. Finally, millennials are in their peak home buying years. Finally, a new survey from Zillow found that 70% of homeowners said they would feel comfortable moving to a new home if there were widespread vaccine distribution, compared with just 52% who feel that way as things stand now. What that means, is that demand is expected to increase as Covid 19 moves further and further into our rear-view mirror. It has gotten to the point where there are affordability concerns. Demand has gone so off the charts that a record 26.4% of new homes on the market do not even exist yet. Of the 307,000 homes that were on the market at the end of January, just 42,000 of them had been completed. At 13.7% that was the lowest on record.', 'I will briefly address the ultimatum Ishbka made. It is smart, and while it might cap the ceiling a bit, it substantially raises the floor and protects the wholesale market. There will still be growth in market share. He is basically doing a solid for his clientele because he does not want what Zillow did to real estates to happen to his customers. It will also stunt top line growth for Fairway and Rocket.  Furthermore, the Rocket 8-K for more financing, is also a bullish catalyst for UWMC.', 'So, let us look at some positive catalysts for UWMC:', '· Infrastructure Package to bring more growth, and perhaps even increase productivity. It is a more general positive catalyst, but it is good for UWMC as well.', '· Minimum Wage increase. Whether it be Mitt Romney who wants 10-10.5 and indexed to inflation, or Bernie Sanders 15-dollar minimum wage.', '· Jim Cramer’s interview with the CEO of UWMC.', '· The Q1 Earnings Call and 8Q. I expect a dividend raise, a share buyback, a special dividend, or a combination of all three.', '· HUD’s confirmation of Marcia Fudge as HUD Secretary who is focused on racial equity because minorities (Especially latino’s and African American’s) lag far behind white American’s in home ownership. Fudge has stated in her press interview on March 18th that there is an immediate housing concern in the increasing price of home ownership. The average price of homes is higher in her words, and the “inventory is much less” than hoped. A major problem she noted, is that “Credit is not available and accessible for people who do actually qualify.” She stated that since FHA is in her purview, they would work with issues of “restructuring,” “access to credit,” and the “down payment” as part of the solution for this solution. Finally, she stated that she was going to make sure people who qualify have access to credit, and she shares the same vision as President Biden to include in this plan policies aimed at closing the racial wealth gap. As UWMC handles FHA loans, this is a boon to them.', '· Meeting the growth targets in 2021 and coming back to full employment by the end of 2021.', '· I will mention interest rates, but I do not think it really matters as demand is so over supply that it has stopped mattering. It is also very important to note that rates remain very low by historical standards, and even though they have trended up their still well below pre-pandemic levels. The average interest rate on a new 30-year mortgage loan was above 3.50% in Jan 2020, and those who obtained loans to buy home sin 2019 or prior likely had loan rates close to or even above 4%. Meanwhile refinance rates always tend to be a little higher than rates for new home loans are hovering in the low 3% range.', '· Continuing demand in 2021, and onward.', 'So, what does this mean? Well, let us look at where I am right now. I hold 200 shares at 8.66, and 7 options contracts. UWMC $9 Calls for 4.16 with a breakeven at $10.39, and $7.5 Calls for 5/21 for a break-even price of 10.15. I intend to purchase more shares if it climbs lower, and even purchase more options to average down my cost basis in them (I didn’t buy them at the top, or at the bottom). I will likely roll my April calls to May closer to the expiration date, and I will very likely exercise these shares if they are between the strike price and the premium. I may just exercise them period, so that I can go on to sell covered calls at a price point above what I bought them at. Likely $11-14. This would decrease my cost basis. To exercise these options would cost me 6,000, which I am alright with doing. I also have almost $1,800 in shares, and I intend to raise my share count in this manner. 1) Buy tentatively at 8.95, 2) buy moderately at $8.50, 3) Buy aggressively at $8 and below, and 4) Should It legitimately go below 8 dollars. I may legitimately start liquidating most of my other assets except AMD and a few other select holdings to purchase a massive number of shares in UWMC. Then, I intend to sell covered calls at a share price I would be comfortable selling at, but I do not believe will be met with the strike plus premium and will therefore not be called. The dollar value of my shares should likely reach 2500 on Monday, unless the drop is precipitous, in which case it may rise to 5,000. If it reaches 8 dollars, I will raise it to 10,000. If it goes below the current tangible book value of 7.65, I will likely have an aneurysm at the idiocy, but I will raise my stake to my entire portfolio, excluding my 110 shares of AMD. This will likely be around $24,000 dollars, including my exercised options as my portfolio ranges from $31,000 to $32,000 at current.', 'At the end of the day, I am not in the market to lose money or gamble, but to make it. 25,000 at a five percent dividend yield is 1,250. And I expect the dividend to be raised more and more. The company has a fortress of a balance sheet, competitive and technological advantages over its competitors, and the largest market share in a highly fragmented field where it can take even more. It is also increasing its profit margin YoY. I do like Rocket too, and that is why I have 50 shares in it, but its P/E ratio is far above UWMC’s and is equivalent to a value stock. While I do think it is going to go higher, I think that UWMC is the correct play at current.', 'If a 7-10 percent increase in the share price due to Russel inclusion where the share price would have increased 62 cents to 89 cents is the metric which you would have bought and held this company, then you are a swing trader and while it is unfortunate it is ultimately small potatoes. I would heavily, heavily, urge you to reconsider selling because the potential upside is much higher than the downside. The stock going below 8 means that the price to book value in May will be less than 1, and by a not insignificant degree. Patience.', 'This has honestly been such a long write up I’m not even going into the Total Fertility Rate for generational population growth (and thus demand/inventory over the next 1-3 generations), because I think this is enough.', 'I do expect, despite this report I’ve compiled, that there will be a significant amount of paper handling, and I’m okay with that because I believe in the fundamentals of this company and I can wait. Lowering cost averages is what I do. I expect a runup in late April to earnings, and some juicy announcements come Q1 2020 Earnings. I’ll also tune in to Jim Cramer’s interview with the CEO when it happens.', 'Thanks for reading. I shall go ahead and state that this is not financial advice, but the thought process that I am going through with this on a forward moving basis.

Around this time, MMs start quoting stock and option prices in penny increments instead of quarters, meaning MMs had to compete with each other by taking a risk on holding onto the right securities at the right time.

Shitadel Securities does so well that Kenny starts getting cocky and thinks he can turn Shitadel into an **Investment Bank**, the king of Chicago. But Wall Street smells his bullshit all the way from New York, and Kenny fails to penetrate the industry.', \"Devastated. For the first time in Kenny's padded, cushiony life, he faces what still isn't real hardship. Too uncool for the club, it's at this point that Kenny decides to take out his insecurities (aha, get it?) on retail investors. Shitadel doubles down on something we are all now familiar with: **Payment for Order Flow**, a practice pioneered by none other than **Bernie Madoff**. E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, First Trade, TradeStation,  Interactive Brokers Lite, and yes, Robinhood, all contract with Shitadel for PFOF.
