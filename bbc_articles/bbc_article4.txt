Police had a machete thrown at them from a window as they broke up a "selfish" and "brazen" Covid-breach house party.
Fourteen people were fined for attending the party in Fairfield, Liverpool, in the early hours.
Officers had been alerted by a member of the public at about 01:00 GMT.
Evidence of drug use was found inside the Prescot Road home alongside a diary of other "party flat" bookings, Merseyside Police said.
The force said a large number of people fled and a machete was thrown at police from an upstairs window.
Ch Insp Chris Barnes said: "The brazen nature of these people is astounding, as is their selfishness to continue as normal, despite the sacrifices being made by the majority.
"It is simple, a house party could mean that someone loses a loved one or a family member to coronavirus in a few weeks' time.
"It is also likely to increase the pressure on our already stretched healthcare services.
"We will continue to take action where people are flouting the restrictions."
