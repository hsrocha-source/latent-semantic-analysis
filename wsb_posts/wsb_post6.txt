Yeah so obviously the market is falling today.  But it's also the case that there's no such thing as free money.  The opportunity that presents itself to me right now, buying a PUT on SPY, would appear to be free money.  THEREFORE.  If I buy this PUT right now, the market will reverse and go back up.  Or will completely freeze and time decay will get me.  Anyway, just let me know what you guys want me to do.  Wouldn't want to mess up the plans of any other put-holders out there by freezing the decline in it's tracks.  However, perhaps I can be of service to those who want the market to go back up.Huh, it worked.  Maybe I can start collecting commissions for my super power.
