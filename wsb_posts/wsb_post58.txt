Since you are all fucking retards, you might not realize the IRS requires you to pay taxes as you make money.  They're constantly quoting Dirty saying "If you wana look good and not be bummy, girl you better give me that money".So in order not to get bitch slapped with fees and penalties, you need to pay estimated taxes quarterly.This is done by filling form 1040ES [Found here](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-es)First quarter 2021 is due April 15th [due dates and FAQ](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/estimated-tax)You most likely will need to do this if you will owe 1k or more.  If you have regular income and have income taxes deducted through payroll, you should only need to pay estimated taxes on your capital gains I'm not a CPA or financial advisor, so don't quote me boy, cause I ain't saying shit.You should consult a tax advisor or CPA if you have questions.Edit: As u/plumpstegadon reminded me, you can also adjust your W2 withholding to pay your taxes too.Edit2:  [IRS Withholding Estimator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator)Edit3: As per u/squatomatic which I believe is correct: "I've been filing my taxes by hand for a few years now, my understanding is that your tax payments made through the year need to be either at least as much as your tax liability from the previous year, or within 10% of your actual liability. So if your withholdings are at least as much as last year you can probably just cut them a check when you pay your next taxes. Unless that changes somehow with capital gains or large amounts? I'm not an accountant, that's just what I've read in the 1040 instructions."Edit4: Article from turbo tax about estimated taxes https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/irs-tax-forms/what-is-irs-form-1040-es-estimated-tax-for-individuals/L384qHYFm
