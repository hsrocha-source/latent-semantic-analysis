I’ve seen many pointing to the lyrics of the song as the kids ride a boat down the chocolate river and into a tunnel. I actually think this is more on-the-nose than that.The story of Charlie Bucket is one where he & a few other children find Golden Tickets. First off, I think we all know what the golden ticket represents. Upon arriving at the factory, the children are given an everlasting gobstopper and told to not sell or give it away. Through the journey, there are many crazy, stressful things that occur to the voyagers, many ups-and-downs that must be persevered. The man attempting to steal Mr. Wonka’s gobstopper recipe is able to convince and/or con the children out of theirs .... except for Charlie Bucket. In the end, he returns the gobstopper to Mr. Wonka, and is thus rewarded with everything he had dreamt of. In the end, he literally breaks through the glass ceiling and rises above all the other children who just couldn’t .... hold.On to the Wonkavator
