So hear me out, Shkreli is a mod here WSB and while we all know he has some ethical issues, the main concern of which is buying the sole copy of  [Once Upon a Time in Shaolin ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Shaolin)and keeping it for himself. Now I don't have anything to wager a Pharma exec of value, and drinking piss is a tried thing here.So my thinking we as a community make a little fun wager, if GME doesn't hit $1000 by May we change the WSB to Shrekli for 3 weeks, if it does he drops the Wu-Tang Album for free to all.I know he browses this sub, although maybe not officially since I think he is still in prison, but I've been listening to a lot of Wu-Tang recently and this is mainly just a lazy way to peer pressure people more powerful than me.So in summary of my very short post, we make a wager with Shkreli of changing the logo to him for 3 weeks if GME doesn't hit $1000 by May and if it does he drops the Album. Is anyone willing to do this?u/zjz u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAREdit - Apparently capitals matter - u/MartinShkreliSome are asking how we would pull this over given the album being in Federal Custody, to which I say thats on Martin's end to atleast issue a challenge to the seuizure or attempt in some other way to reclaim his assets
