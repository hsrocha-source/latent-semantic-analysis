My theory is based in part on a post by u/theycallmeryan it is required reading. 
Tldr; The feds QE hasnt made banks willing to give loans as was their intention, causing liquidity to dry up. Banks are hoarding. Big players using cheap QE money to invest inflates the market. The unprecedented influx of retail investors, also inflating the market, will taper off once everyone and their mom is in the market, de-fueling the bull run.

Now think about this in our current setting. The whole market is red.  GME is a stock thats holding strong in the middle of what, imo, is likely going to be the beginning of a market crash.Wallstreet is reading all wsb posts right now. They know the GME holders the only force in the market that wont panic sell no matter what. In fact, the impending squeeze will be the the catalyst that causes the crash, as the short hedgefunds sell their longs to cover their shorts. Every big shark and whale in the market that isnt short GME will join the feedingfrenzy.Wallstreet will take this opportunity to allow the crash to happen with WSB as a convenient scapegoat. Notice how CNBC subtly frames every reporting on WSB as a market manipulation. Every comment they show is some newbie saying "lets run up this stock next". Theyre preparing to, like any good sociopath, to blame us for a thing that they themselves are guilty of.Positions: Cash, GME shares, GO shares, a penny ticker, and NOK, in that order.I
