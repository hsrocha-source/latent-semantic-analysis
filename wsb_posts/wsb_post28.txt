In the last month, TSLA has dropped 36%. I'm curious as to why it may have been so affected. The stock dip seems a little extreme compared to any of the potentially negative public news rumors that I've read:  
* There was a two-week production line shut down due to battery supply issues that have been restarted.
* Price cut to Japan car imports.
* Discussion of federal interest rate hikes that could affect growth stocks that were later alleviated to some degree.
* Tesla did not announce a hard number for expected deliveries for 2021. Instead, they said that they expect more than 50% growth this year due to a doubling of their gigafactories.
* Tesla bought $1.5 billion of digit currency which opens them up to additional risk
* Ford Mustang EV has launched, though the number of units sold has been quite minimal  
I read in a number of articles that TSLA is the number one shorted stock. I wonder how much that may be affecting the current stock price. With their new factories, the price of their digital currency, new CyberTruck, new tradeable, automotive regulatory tax credits, and the new EV tax credits being discussed. I was leaning towards 2021 being another big year for TSLA.  
By and large, there has been a lack of Tesla-related news this quarter for this amount of movement. I wasn't expecting Q1 to be great but this seems crazy.
