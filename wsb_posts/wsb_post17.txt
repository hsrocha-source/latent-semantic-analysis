Before I begin, I want to stress that nothing, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, is more important than your mental health, and if the market is impeding that, it might be -- and likely is -- time to step aside and focus on your health.That said, March has been a metaphorical blood bath, there's no denying it. The pain and frustration that comes with watching your portfolio shrink, and your money disappear is a sobering kick in the ass -- especially for doe-eyed investors just starting out. But this is the reality of investing. Stocks go up, and stocks go down. If you've invested more than you can afford to lose, days like these are going to be hell. I empathize with you, as we've all been there at one point or another. Ego is the arch-nemesis of success, especially when a bull market turns. And our mistakes will always come back to collect.That said, March has served as an incredible learning opportunity. If you're freaking out this month, you're probably too invested, or your research was underdeveloped. To that I say, consider reevaluating your process, tinkering with it, figuring out ways to help you manage months like these. Because its not the first, and certainly will not be the last. Play with risk tolerance, accept that mitigating risk might mean settling for smaller gains. Or that high risk speculation, mean just that. HIGH RISK.Pullbacks, when played right, and analyzed correctly, tend to breed better investors. These losses, theoretical or otherwise, are the tuition we pay to learn. I hope that all of you come out on the right side of this month, and that you've learned something in the process. Here's to greener days!(obligatory, i am not a financial advisor, nothing i say matters, don't listen to me, i'm dumb as a stump)
