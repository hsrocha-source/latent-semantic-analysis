Hey guys,So recently I was thinking..Hedge funds want to protect themselves from a future GME incident and have obviously developed algorithms to essentially parse through WSB and see what stocks are gaining momentum. The problem is that it’s extremely easy to parse through Reddit and find what post has a lot of upvotes and capture which stock ticker is mentioned. So, I was thinking why not make it more difficult for these bots (potentially causing further headaches for these hedgies) Why don’t we create a program that converts text to images that can’t be parsed so easily.. kind of like a captcha system that bots can’t easily win. This will make it way more difficult to parse and we can get a time advantage. As we know timing is essential here. Obviously, it’s easy for hedge funds to hire actual people to search through WSB and find the next stock that gains momentum; but that takes significantly more time; there has to be a solution here too .. I just don’t know what it is.Whatever the case, I WONT be surprised if hedge funds are hiring people right now to write the code to go through Reddit to protect themselves. Let’s at least give them a major headache!
Edit: sharing ideas on a forum shouldn’t be illegal. Algos manipulating stock prices and hurting retail traders should be ILLEGAL. I want to be able to share ideas to real humans and not bots designed to fuck us over. That’s all I’m saying.Edit #2: Potentially we can use ReCaptcha something that’s has been out for a long time (Google has developed this over many years) before allowing access to any DD.Edit #3: I really like this suggestion by /u/TheLegendDevil: “One way to beat them would be a browser plugin that changes your comment before posting to make all words that are close to being a ticker actually a ticker. Easy way to one way encode messages and humans should still be able to decipher what stock they were actually talking about.”
