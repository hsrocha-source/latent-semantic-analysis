GME has now formed a double base(2nd forming)consolidation(generally thought of as a launching platform) and has generally been uptrending.  AMC, on the other hand, has fallen off and popped off the 7.5ish support level for the 3d time in the past 7 days.What does this mean?  Possibly that AMC is a sideshow to GME, and the weaker of the two.  If this earnings season has shown anything, its the old adage of "buy the rumor, sell the news".  We know AMC is reopening, etc, etc; but it has faced serious stock dilution and is not behaving the right way.  GME has confirmed less than 10 mil available to short, and solid mechanical probability of squeezing higher. But what do I know?  I just went full retard.
