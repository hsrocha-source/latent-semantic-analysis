I just ran $3000 into GME this which is all I have in stocks, I tried making money the clean and fair way. Was up to $8,000 on Cciv from my initial investment of $2250 then these cuck scumbags announced after Robin Hood closed(fuck Robin Hood btw.) and I woke up to $38/share and took my $2k profit and jerked off with my said tears thinking about $8000. Then I picked myself up and told myself don’t worry about it, there’s more to be made. Now look at this fucking market it’s a red sand desert and GME is the fucking oasis. Here I am now. Either way, why play fair when the deck is stacked so high for the hedge funds and Wall Street. I’m holding, there are two outcomes here. We win and the world is right, we lose and this is not a market I want to invest in because I wasn’t born into a rich family so I’m not allowed to get rich. Fucking yolo, I apologize for my past transgressions GME it is the way. I won’t be drinking any piss, or getting any tattoos, not gonna suck any farts out of my wife’s boyfriends ass.....but I like the stock.
