Alright- I lubed up and now I am ready to provide my insight into the purple call. First of all, the analysts still love purple.  46% average estimated upside, with the top analyst indicating 70%+ upside. Price movement today is very bullish, since the overall markets are tanking. I believe we will make a quick recovery into the mid to 30's. It might be a minute before we see the 40's, nonetheless I'm still bullish on the company, even though it took my anal flower. Purple was down nearly 15% before the earnings call and it dropped another 33% on the day of the call.# I HAVE NOT REDUCED MY POSITION&#x200B;[tip ranks](https://preview.redd.it/m00nmsbtl8l61.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ddeb4808a16069df74bdb50dde3c62284fdf89)# Highlights from the call* purple is adding 20-25 stores company owned showroom - Previous calls indicated 3-5M in sales expected for the year, per store. This will setup 2022 nicely. 2020 ended with 13 show rooms owned by purple.

   * 840-880M vs my 875M anticipated.
* Purple is expanding into 1500 more retail stores

* Purple is still capacity constrained overall and the miss from Q4 is mostly related to them not communicating on the calls and soft demand from wholesale that has since picked up. This seems counter intuitive but it helps explain the inventory build up in Q4.
* **Purple has 3% of the Mattress Market but 6% of the premium market.**
* Purple expects 31-36% growth for 2021 and 2021 is their investment year that was delayed from 2020.
* Gross Margins were 47% for Q4 and they indicated they would likely remain flat in 2022 even with more mix into wholesale.
* Purple still sees opportunity in cushioning.
* Purple is launching a new product in early Q2
* Purple sees tons of runway in DTC through their showrooms and increased efficiency in the online sales.
* Purple finally is getting capacity constraints out of the way.https://preview.redd.it/4jyfes2ru8l61.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a98eef33412777a097c71825a39a629ce293b01* Purple has 130M in cash and is self funding 40-50 Million in Capex and still anticipating delivering 90-100M EBITDA
   * This is the most Bullish thing IMO- investing 50M in capex is bullish AF.&#x200B;&#x200B;# The BADPurple missed revenue in Q4- According to them it was because their communication wasn't clear and analysts over estimated. Purple committed to better communication this year, **thank GOD.**The accruals??? wtf- I need help from u/indonesian_activist and u/lurkingsince2006 I don't understand why we didn't have a big fat paper gain.# The Future* Purple has beat revenue guidance for the last 2 years by significant amounts, this will become challenging the bigger they get but I expect this year will be no different.
* Wholesale demand is as strong as ever.

Curtis Nagle is asking a question on the call and the CEO answers.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/5gi0it2ix8l61.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=14c09d8bc68926c5a261d35cc8937632e19ba476# The plays-I got nothing for you here other than to buy shares- Even my selling puts really really hurt me on this drop. Long term it's a great hold IMO and it will continue to outperform.# Timing-2022 is going to be their most profitable year and hopefully we see more of the systematic profit/investment type reporting that the other players are reporting like.# The RisksThere have now been 2 great NRPLINGS, proceed with caution. &#x200B;Love you guys.
