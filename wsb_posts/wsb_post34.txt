I bought at 30-40. Sold at 110. Bought a bunch more at 280-300. I had made enough in the first run up to cover my secondary purchase, so it was 'free', in a way. When that was the case watching the drop to 45 from my \~290 was disheartening, but I didn't/haven't sell/sold. This past week, when my normal portfolio of tech and Tesla has dropped $100+k, I don't even bat an eye. In fact I just keep buying more. Diamond handing is not just good for meme stocks, its a wonderful lesson that all investors could learn from. Thanks apes.Retards strong. Rocket Rocket. etc.
