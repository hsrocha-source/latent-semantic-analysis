*Before I start this post, I want to apologise for the late DD. Last few days we've seen quite a change in options trading throughout the operating hours of the market and I wanted to use the latest data for this post so it wouldn't be misleading. To those that know me from my previous DD, you'd know I threw a dart blindfolded (and high on coke) to predict a squeeze on the 24th (Close enough, I'll take it). I've tried to keep this post short as possible because 90% of you retards have the attention span of a 2-month-old dog.*Gamma Squeeze Quick Recap**Gamma squeeze can begin when a large investor, typically referred to as a whale, buys short-dated call options**. The banks or brokers that sell the call options will typically buy the underlying stock so that they have very little or no net exposure. **The more call options the investor buys, the more shares the brokers that sold the options will have to buy to ensure they are net flat**. Brokers and dealers are motivated by the commissions and do not want to hold a trade either long or short. Given that these whales buy calls, the option purchases force the dealers to buy the underlying stock, which can push the share price higher. *If pulled off, this creates a positive feedback loop, thus can drive underlying stock(s) price higher for a period of time. In a roundabout way, the dealers must buy more and more of the underlying.*When the price of the stock reaches above the strike price (In the Money), those who've bought the call options **may** exercise their right to buy the shares.Why does this matter?Well first let's look at the call options expiring this Friday (5th march) that are OTM currently. Just pretend to stare at the tables if you can't read, I'll explain later.&#x200B;&#x200B;[Call options on 2nd March](https://preview.redd.it/748f9dojo8l61.jpg?width=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=573a5e17efd9d4c303511e41f9562456c2d362e9)&#x200B;* Volume \~ 46.4k

* Shares above the $150 strike price \~ 3.627M
* **OPEN INTEREST \~** **43.04k**# Open Interest and IV**Comparing the options chain between the two days, it could be seen that yesterday there was 43k in open interest in contrast to 0 on 2nd march. Why is this important?***Open interest gives you key information regarding the* *liquidity* *of an option, it reflects upon the number of contracts that are ACTIVELY held by investors and traders (These are the positions that have been opened and not closed yet).*If there is no open interest in an option, there is no secondary market for that option. When options have a significant open interest, it means there are a large number of buyers and sellers out there. An active secondary market increases the odds of getting option orders filled at good prices. At its core, open interest paints a picture of how much capital is being injected into a given market. Keeping an eye on open interest is vital to identifying trends, in that growing open interest signifies that an influx of money is likely to stimulate action and aid price extension. Conversely, falling open interest alludes to activity “drying up” or capital exiting the market. This suggests that the presence of any prevailing trend is short-lived and adopting a reversal strategy may be the best course of action.*All other things being equal, the bigger the open interest, the easier it will be to trade that option at a reasonable* *spread* *between the bid and ask.***Linking back to the GME options chain, a significant 43.04k call options (going long) accumulated yesterday when compared to 0 of the previous day (2nd March) .** The rising prices during the uptrend (as seen in the last few hours of the market on 3rd march) coupled with the rising open interest, can mean that new money is coming into the market and **can be a sign of bullish sentiment.**Another point I'd like to make is the implied volatility which is extremely high for the options chains with a strike price above $150 (Yes I'm looking at you Mr. $800). As expectations, or demand, rises for an option, the implied volatility (IV) increases proportionally and leads to a higher option premium due to the risky nature of the option. **Why would any sensible investor buy 9.7k calls with a 906% IV if the stock was bound to plummet**? And no, calls these huge are *probably not* bought by retail traders or people YOLOing. There's something larger at play and will probably require another post for institutional funds and hedgies ownership in GME (Trying to keep it on topic for now). The only viable reason I see is that large whales or investors see the potential for another gamma squeeze before the end of the week.EDIT 2: Took a look at the gamma squeeze predictor tool made by [u/indonesian\_activist](https://www.reddit.com/u/indonesian_activist/) and will link the post here as well[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxkeg0/repost\_gme\_squeeze\_calculator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxkeg0/repost_gme_squeeze_calculator/)
