Over the past few days I have been developing and updating a model for making estimates for what value GME is trending to. Below is my hypothesis of Proportional Trend Mapping.The hypothesis of proportional trend mapping for GME is that the trend and charts for the current run of GME match the run in January close enough that we can map values using a coefficient called a difference factor. A difference factor is the proportion of the current value of GME in the February/March run to the January run. The assumption is that the conditions and external forces now are nearly identical to those in January, and that they will continue to be nearly identical.So below is an expansion of of this hypothesis that we are following the same trend. Note DFF is differential difference factor. The Difference factor is the a comparison of the value from the current run divided by the value from the January run. The DDF is a comparison of the day to day change for the current run divided by the day to day change for the January run.Closing Values From the January Run Up Compared to March Run Up1/11/21 / 19.94 || 2/22/21 / 46.00 || Difference Factor 2.311/12/21 / 19.95 || 2/23/21 / 44.97 || Difference Factor 2.25 [Day2Day Change -0.01||-1.03; DDF 10300]1/13/21 / 31.40 || 2/24/21 / 91.71 || Difference Factor 2.92 [Day2Day Change 11.45||46.74; DDF 4.08 ]1/14/21 / 39.91 || 2/25/21 / 108.73 || Difference Factor 2.72 [Day2Day Change 8.51||17.02; DDF 2]1/15/21 / 35.50 || 2/26/21 / 101.74 || Difference Factor 2.87 [Day2Day Change -4.41||-6.99; DDF 1.59]1/19/21 / 39.36 || 3/1/21 / 120.41 || Difference Factor 3.07 [Day2Day Change 3.86||18.67; DFF 4.84]1/20/21 / 39.12 || 3/2/21 / 118.00 || Difference Factor 3.02 [Day2Day Change -0.24||-2.41; DFF 10.04]1/21/21 / 43.03 || 3/3/21 / 124.18 || Difference Factor 2.89 [Day2Day Change 3.91||6.18; DFF 1.58]1/22/21 / 65.01 || 3/4/21 / 132.35 || Difference Factor 2.04 [Day2Day Change 21.98||8.17; DFF 0.37]**1/25/21 / 76.79 || 3/5/21 (<- we are here)**1/26/21 / 147.98 || 3/8/211/27/21 / 347.51 || 3/9/21The average difference factor is 2.68, the maximum is 3.07, and the minimum is 2.04. The standard deviation is 0.3772.The reason I say we are following the January pattern is because of two factors; 1) the difference factor is generally around the average difference factor 2) the day to day changes generally follow the same "pattern" as January (on days that had negative change in January, there was negative change now, and this is true for increases and stagnant days).In my initial calculation I assumed a 10% margin of error because I was mostly doing back of envelope calculations only looking at key points. The margin of error has now been expanded to equal to the standard deviation divided by the average difference factor, which is currently 14.09%. Based on the average difference factor above and an error of 14.09%. below are my updated estimates for the price for today and the next few days.3/5/21 / $205.80 +/-$29.003/8/21 / $396.59 +/-$55.883/9/21 / $931.33 +/-$131.22If this follows, then the peak value below should be achieved between opening bell March 8th and closing bell March 10th**PEAK VALUE** Previous run / $483.00 || This run / $1294.44 +/-$182.39I will be updating this as the next few days progress, posting updates in the GME general thread. Chances are that by Monday my model won't track the current trajectory at all. Luckily, my calculations for the error have been getting tighter over the past few days, so my intuition may be wrong here. That being said, keep my calculations in mind and watch the stock!**I am not a financial advisor nor an analyst. Just an idiot with excel and a dream!**
