Do we think it's a problem that this group votes down any opinion that isnt completely bullish on their investments which gives readers a completely biased view of stock situations which leads to major losses for many investors? These low karma posts are then not viewable. Huge funds and short sellers have made millions In the past few months taking money off amateur retail investors who (lots of them) take advice from this group. Robin hood and other apps work in tandem or alongside these funds and profiting off nearly every move this group makes both upwards and downwards. I've traded in the city for 13 years and the guys there are laughing their heads off at this group, some have bought new houses off the back of gamestop alone. We need to talk about this because I feel morally obliged to say something when good people are wasting their (or let's he honest , their parents) hard earned money.
