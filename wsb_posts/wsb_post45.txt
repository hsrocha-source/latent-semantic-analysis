As some of you probably know on march 10th Roblox will have it's IPO under the ticker $RBLX.Now there's been quite a few articles about that and many boomers probably know Roblox from their children (edit: or grandchilden/great-grandchildren relax guys), so there will probably be a fair demand for it on march 10th.The interesting thing is there's a company called Robex Resources. They do something gold related I think, but that's not really important. What's important is their stock ticker - it's $RBX. Basically I think there's potential for this stock to rise on march 10th because a bunch of people mistake it for Roblox.Obviously this is a stupid gamble, so that's why I thought you guys might like it :)Edit: Seems like it's ticker is just $RBX on canadian stock exchanges? Makes it even more of a stupid gamble, but I'm staying in.Edit2: While the ticker is only $RBX on tsx and neo (canada), checkout $AMC on those exchanges (as u/Pestty13 pointed out, ty)TL;DR Boomers might buy $RBX instead of $RBLX lol idiotsPosition: 200@0.317€ RBX
