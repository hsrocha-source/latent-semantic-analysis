Futures, stocks and options trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment.The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent advice from your financial advisor. **All trading strategies are used at your own risk.****DISCLAIMER#2:** The risk associated with any position you take is inversely proportionate to your bank roll. The act of selling naked calls or shorting stock carries with it an infinite amount of risk. Unless you’re a over-leveraged clown of a fund manager, then by all means your losses will be capped by The House.
